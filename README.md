## 🧑‍💻Developmemt

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Taghash uses a client server architecture.

### ⚒️Tooling

📌 VS Code as the preferred code editor.

📌 NPM to manage pacakges and dependencies

📌 Prettier for code formatting.

## 💻 Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to Challenges II:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/Bismay5467/Challenges.git))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/Challenges.git
```
3. Switch To Challanges II folder.
   
4. Setup all the dependencies and packages on client by running `npm ci`.

```sh
cd client && npm ci
```

5. Setup all the dependencies and packages on server by running `python3 model.py`.

```sh
cd server && python3 model.py
```

Now you are good to go!! Client would be running on PORT 5173 and Server would be running on PORT 5000! 🚀✨
